## How to get the workshop materials: 

- Users new to R and RStudio should use the pre-built Posit Cloud environment available at https://posit.cloud/content/7549022.  

- Advanced users familiar with R and RStudio should clone the repository to their computers with the command `git clone https://github.com/walkerke/umich-workshop-2024.git`.  They should then install the following R packages, if not already installed:

```r
pkgs <- c("tidycensus", "tidyverse", "mapview", "survey", "srvyr", "rdeck", "tigris", "ggspatial", "leafsync",
"patchwork")

install.packages(pkgs)
```

Experienced users should re-install __tidycensus__ and __tigris__ to get the latest updates and ensure that all code used in the workshop will run.  

Other packages used will be picked up as dependencies of these packages on installation. 

A Census API key is recommended to access the Census API.  Participants can sign up for a key at https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html (it generally takes just a few minutes).
